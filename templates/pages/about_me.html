                <p>I am a seasoned Cyber Security Engineer with over 20 years of experience protecting enterprise systems and supporting risk-informed decision-making across Department of Defense environments. I currently serve in a DevSecOps-focused role with U.S. Transportation Command, where I provide comprehensive security risk assessments, ensure compliance with security frameworks, and support the secure development and operation of mission-critical applications. Throughout my career, I have built deep expertise in network security, firewalls, vulnerability management, and Risk Management Framework (RMF) processes, consistently helping organizations safeguard sensitive data while enabling operational success.</p>
                
                <p>My professional background spans leadership roles in the U.S. Army, the U.S. Air Force, and multiple cybersecurity organizations, where I have led teams, conducted incident response operations, managed cross-domain security initiatives, and delivered enterprise vulnerability assessments. I also bring a strong academic foundation, holding an MBA and multiple graduate degrees in cybersecurity and information systems security, along with industry certifications such as CompTIA Security+, Network+, Project+, and ITIL. In addition, my experience as an adjunct instructor highlights my commitment to mentoring and developing the next generation of IT and cybersecurity professionals.</p>
